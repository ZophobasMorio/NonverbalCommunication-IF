Part 1 - Scenes

[SCENES	===	===	===	===	===	===]

[INTRO]

When play begins:
	say "It's the wee hours of a warm summer night and you're toiling away in your workshop, frantically preparing for an imminent invasion. You almost dropped your crystal ball in shock when your latest survey of the lands revealed a dragon heading straight for your tower![line break]And not just any dragon [unicode 8211] the fearsome Ignipter, who has an old grudge against you. You suspect that if you don't erect your defenses in time, the only thing left of your home by sunrise will be rubble.[line break]";
	wait for any key;
	say "[line break]> EXAMINE CRYSTAL [line break]A rare iridescent gem, packed so full of magical energy that it's practically buzzing. This should serve as the perfect core for your dragonproof armour...[line break]";
	wait for any key;
	say "[line break]> PUT CRYSTAL IN CHESTPLATE [line break]
You delicately insert the gem into a small cavity on the front of the ornate metal chestplate, reciting an incantation to bind your protective Words to both objects.[line break]Suddenly, a stray spark of magic singes your hand, which reflexively jerks sideways. That's all it takes to break apart the hastily-assembled mechanism designed to harness the gem's power, and raw magical energy starts pouring into the room!";
	wait for any key;
	say "[line break]The swirling billows engulf you. As you lose consciousness, you feel a horrible turmoil rising up from your chest...";
	wait for any key;
	clear the screen;
	wait for any key;
	say "The sun is already warming your face when you awaken. A wave of panic rushes over you, and you jump to your feet[unicode 8211]";
	wait for any key;
	say "[line break]you jump to your feet[unicode 8211]";
	wait for any key;
	say "[line break]...why are your legs not obeying you?";
	wait for any key;
	say "[line break]It dawns on you: your Words are gone.[line break]Ever since you bound your life force to the English language, you've relied on them for almost every aspect of life, and now they've been pulled right out of your mouth at the worst possible time by the magical maelstrom![line break]Indeed, to a Word Mage, words are not only tools for communication, they're also the very root of a person's interactions with the outside world; without words, there's no way for you to LIGHT LAMP, EAT PASTA, or even just ENJOY POETRY.[line break][line break]But you don't have the luxury of waiting to get your words back. You'll just have to do without!";
	wait for any key;
	now the right hand status line is "[Aline] [Bline] [Cline] [Dline] [Eline] [Fline] [Gline]";
	continue the action.


[*** Most of the scenes were not used in the end, as I found other ways to create the "cutscenes" I needed]

[Every turn while the player is in the Workshop and the player is unpeeped:
	say "Lying on the workshop floor, you think about your predicament. You've thankfully held on to your ability to THINK and WAIT, but you can't seem to find the capacity for any other actions, and you notice that even your senses are greatly dulled.[line break]You're not too worried about your nouns; obedient and predictable, nouns always seek refuge in familiar objects whenever they're orphaned. Even in this sorry state, you should be able to call on their power when they're nearby.[line break]But verbs are independent, fickle things, and although you feel the presence of some of your most beloved verbs within the tower, you doubt you'll be able to compel them directly.[line break][line break]";
	now the player is peeped.]

[MEMORIES]
	
[After opening the locket for the first time:
	say "You open the locket. You find the word APOLOGIZE. [line break]You collect it. [line break]";
	now the APOLOGIZE is sought;
	wait for any key;
	continue the action.]
	
[I CAN SEE CLEARLY NOW]
	
[Every turn while the player is wearing the Gazer Automaton and the Gazer Automaton is unpeeped:
say "The strap that connects the Gazer Automaton's arms tightens abruptly across the back of your head, securing the glasses to your face. You can see your surroundings clearly now![line break]You take a moment to look around the room.";
now the Gazer Automaton is peeped;
continue the action.]

		say "The Ambler Automaton steps out into the yard. Your eyes widen as you're immediately confronted with the sight of Ignipter, who was waiting outside your tower![line break][line break]Luckily, the Collector Automaton runs out after you.

She leaps away in a panic and flies unsteadily towards the horizon.[line break][line break]";
		wait for any key;
		say "[line break]Months later, you've regained most of your words and are back to toiling away in your workshop (never again without gloves!)[line break]You haven't seen or heard from Ignipter since the incident, which is a relief.[line break]But without ever admitting it to anyone, even to yourself... deep down, you still miss her.";

		say "[line break][line break]You can only watch helplessly as the beast lowers her head towards you, baring fangs almost as long as you are tall. Finding yourself completely defenseless, you feel a primal energy surge deep within you. A gnawing feeling of emptiness is suddenly replaced by the biggest adrenaline rush you've ever felt – the verb FLEE has galloped back to you, drawn in by your instincts and panic!
With no hesitation and no effort spared, pushing your restricted physical and magical capacities to their limits, you abandon your tower and escape towards a nearby cave. Ignipter roars something in Draconic that you don't understand (presumably a threat) as you scramble away.";
		wait for any key;
		say "[line break]Months later, you've regained most of your words and come out of hiding. You haven't seen or heard from Ignipter since the incident, which is a relief. But you still live in fear of another invasion, and you often find yourself wondering what could have been...";

But your gaze slowly shifts to her eyes, and you're surprised to find them filled with apprehension and sadness. Is this what you were so afraid of?[line break]The weight of the wasted decades, of the guilt, of the frustration at the futility of it all, is almost too much to bear. This time, you don't let yourself sink.
[line break][line break]'I'm sorry.'[line break][line break]She roars mournfully.[line break][line break]'I'm so sorry...'";

But on your nightstand, a book on healthy communication lies atop [italic type]Draconic for Dummies[roman type], and you've purged all dragonsbane from your property.[line break]Whenever you spot a familiar dragon in your crystal ball, heading straight for your tower, you're now filled with a warm happiness.";

Be aware that any broken object will lose its noun and verb, which will put it outside your sphere of influence![line break][line break]Three different endings can be obtained at the end of the game, the first of which has two possible variations. The ending you get depends on your approach (or lack thereof) to dealing with the dragon.[line break]Although most of the default commands have been disabled, these ones can still be used: UNDO, SAVE, RESTORE, RESTART, QUIT, CREDITS, WAIT, TRANSCRIPT, VERIFY, VERSION.";

Chapter 3.1 - Rooms

[ROOMS	====	====	====]

[*** A bad copy/paste job in the first release of the game led to a line like this being in every room transition:
	if the dragonsbane is nabbed, now the locket is in the [room];
The correct line (with 'locket' instead of 'dragonsbane') was supposed to allow the Collector to carry the locket around the tower. But the error led to the locket instead wandering the tower on its own, following the player, even when the dresser was still unopened... :)]

[FASTENER]

Fastening is an action applying to nothing. Understand "fastener" and "fastener automaton" as fastening.
Ambler fastening is an action applying to nothing.
Basher fastening is an action applying to nothing.
Collector fastening is an action applying to nothing.
Depositor fastening is an action applying to nothing.
Exposer fastening is an action applying to nothing.
Fastener fastening is an action applying to nothing.
Gazer fastening is an action applying to nothing.

Check fastening:
	if the Fastener Automaton is smushed, say "You no longer sense the presence of that noun; it must have fled after its vessel was detroyed." instead.
Check collector fastening:   
	  if the Fastener Automaton is smushed, say "The [bold type]Collector Automaton[roman type] fails to find a noun to act upon." instead.
Check exposer fastening:     
	  if the Fastener Automaton is smushed, say "The [bold type]Exposer Automaton[roman type] fails to find a noun to act upon." instead.
Check fastener fastening:    
	  if the Fastener Automaton is smushed, say "The [bold type]Fastener Automaton[roman type] fails to find a noun to act upon." instead.
Check gazer fastening:

Carry out fastening:
	if the Fastener Automaton is visible, say "You extend your energy towards the Fastener Automaton. As your magic touches the noun, its power briefly ebbs outwards, beckoning to all verbs near you.";
	else say "The word is on the tip of your tongue... or it would be, if it hadn't already escaped your mouth! You sense its presence nearby; it might be hiding somewhere in the tower."
After fastening:
	if the Ambler Automaton is visible and the Fastener Automaton is visible, try ambler fastening;
	if the Basher Automaton is visible and the Basher Automaton is unsmushed and the Fastener Automaton is visible, try basher fastening;
